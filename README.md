# Movie Search Web App

Scenario: You have been assigned the task of developing a Movie Search Application that allows users to search for movies using a third-party open API. The application should utilize asynchronous JavaScript concepts and make use of the Fetch API to fetch movie data from the API. [OMDb API - The Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/). This workshop will focus on implementing the application logic, error handling, and styling. Feel free to customize the design and add additional features as per your requirements.

## Requirements
● Design a user interface (UI) for the Movie Search Application. Include elements
such as an input field for movie search, a button to initiate the search, and a
section to display the movie results.  
● Use HTML and CSS to create the UI for the Movie Search Application.  
● Implement JavaScript code that handles the user input, fetches movie data from a
third-party open API using the Fetch API, and displays the movie results.  
● Handle error cases, such as empty search input or failed API requests, gracefully
by displaying appropriate error messages to the user.  
● Display relevant movie information for each search result, such as the movie title,
release year, poster image, and a brief overview.  
● Add styling to enhance the visual appeal of the Movie Search Application.  
● Test the application by searching for different movies and verifying that the movie
results are displayed correctly.  
● Provide attribution to the third-party API used in your application, following their
usage guidelines and requirements.

## Detailed Steps:

### Set up the project structure:

● Create a new directory for the project.  
● Create an index.html file for the HTML structure.  
● Create a styles.css file for the CSS styling.  
● Create a main.js file for the JavaScript logic.  

### Design the user interface:

● Build the HTML structure for the Movie Search Application, including input
fields and display areas.
● Style the elements using CSS to create an appealing and user-friendly
interface.

### Implement JavaScript code:

● Write JavaScript code in the main.js file to handle user interactions and fetch movie data.  
● Attach an event listener to the button element to handle the click event.  
● Retrieve the user input from the input field and validate it if necessary.  
● Use the Fetch API to send a GET request to a movie API, passing the search term as a parameter.  
● Handle the response using promises or async/await and extract the relevant movie information.  
● Display the retrieved movie data on the webpage.

### Implement error handling:

● Validate user input to ensure it is not empty or invalid.  
● Handle errors that may occur during the API request or data retrieval,
displaying appropriate error messages to the user.

### Style the Movie Search Application:

● Modify the styles.css file to apply custom styles to the UI elements, making
the application visually appealing and responsive.

### Test the application:

● Open the index.html file in a web browser.  
● Enter different movie search terms in the input field and click the search button.  
● Verify that the movie results are displayed correctly and error messages
are shown when necessary.

### Provide attribution:

● Make sure to follow the usage guidelines and requirements of the third-party API used in your application.  
● Provide proper attribution to the API in your application, such as displaying
their logo or mentioning their name.
